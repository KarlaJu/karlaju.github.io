 Tip 1  Always consider the context.

Nothing exists in isolation; everything is part of the system and part of a larger context.
Tip 2  Use rules for novices, intuition for experts.  The journey from novice to expert involves more than just rules and intuition,of course. Many characteristics change as you move up the skill levels. Takes about ten years to become an expertise. So you have to keep practising.
Tip 3  Know what you don&rsquo;t know.  If you&rsquo;re lucky enough to have an expert on your team, you need to accommodate them.

<p>I collected tips and observations from the amazing book: <u>Pragmatic Thinking &amp; Learning written by Andy Hunt.</u></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The essence of pragmatism is to do what works for you.</strong></p>

<p><strong>As you grow and adapt you may need to modify your habits and approaches as well.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="tip-1">Tip 1</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Always consider the context.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Everything is interconnected: the physical world, social systems, your innermost thoughts, the unrelenting logic of the computer—everything forms one immense,  interconnected  system  of  reality.  Nothing  exists  in  isolation; everything is part of the system and part of a larger context.</p>

<h4 id="tip-2">Tip 2</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Use rules for novices, intuition for experts.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The journey from novice to expert involves more than just rules and intuition,of course. Many characteristics change as you move up the skill levels.
Takes about ten years to become an expertise. So you have to keep practising.</p>

<h4 id="tip-3">Tip 3</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Know what you don&rsquo;t know.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>If you&rsquo;re lucky enough to have an expert on your team, you need to accommodate them.</p>

<h4 id="tip-4">Tip 4</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Learn by watching and imitating.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Fisrt you imitate existing practice and then slowly assimilate the tacit knowledge and experience over time. Finally you&rsquo;ll be in a position to go beyond imitation and innovate.</p>

<h4 id="tip-5">Tip 5</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Keep practicing in order to remain expert.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Experts at coding must continue to code and find a meaningful and rewarding career there. Setting a pay scale and a career ladder that reflects a top coder’s value to the organization is the first step toward making this a reality.</p>

<h4 id="tip-6">Tip 6</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Avoid formal methods if you need creativity, intuition or inventiveness.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Don’t succumb to the false authority of a tool or a model. There is no substitute for thinking.</p>

<h4 id="tip-7">Tip 7</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Learn the skill of learning.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>To embark on this path to expertise, we’ll need to do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cultivate more intuition</li>
<li>Realize the increasing importance of context and of observing situational patterns</li>
<li>Better harness our own experience</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="tip-8">Tip 8</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Capture all ideas to get more of them.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The important part is to use something that you always have with you.</p>

<p>Whether it’s paper, a cell phone, an MP3 player, or a PDA doesn’t matter, as long as you always have it.</p>

<p><u>If you don’t keep track of great ideas, you will stop noticing you have them.</u></p>

<h4 id="tip-9">Tip 9</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Learn by synthesis as well as by analysis</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>R-mode’s analogic and holistic thinking styles are very valuable to software architecture and design—that’s the stuff that good designs are made of.</p>

<p>And  you  might  already  be  reaching  for  synthetic  learning  more  often  than you think. When faced with a difficult design problem, or an elusive bug, good programmers generally have an urge to reach for code and build something that they can learn from. That’s R-mode synthesis, as opposed to the L-mode analysis. That’s why we like prototypes and independent unit tests. These give us the opportunity to learn by synthesis—by building.</p>

<h4 id="tip-10">Tip 10</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Strive for good design; it really works better.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>One of the foremost building architects of the twentieth century, Louis Kahn, offers a useful explanation of the relationship between beauty and design: “Design is not making beauty; beauty emerges from selection, affinities, integration, love.”</p>

<h4 id="tip-11">Tip 11</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Rewire your brain with belief and constant practice.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>In either case, what you think about the brain’s capacities physically affects the “wiring” of the brain itself. That’s a pretty profound observation. Just thinking that your brain has more capacity for learning makes it so.</p>

<p>It’s do-it-yourself brain surgery.</p>

<h4 id="tip-12">Tip 12</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Add sensory experience to engage more of your brain.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Instead of trying to create and document a design or architecture directly in a commercial tool (using UML or something similar), use building blocks. Toyblocks. In assorted colors.</p>

<h4 id="tip-13">Tip 13</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Lead with R-mode; follow with L-mode.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Both ways of thinking work naturally together; for instance, start with the analogic processes for connections and theories, and then use the analytic processes to validate your thinking. But remember it’s not a one-way trip; you need to return to R-mode to keep the ideas flowing. R-mode is the source, and you want to give it free, uninhibited reign.</p>

<h4 id="tip-14">Tip 14</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Use metaphor as the meeting place between L-mode and R-mode.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>L-mode and R-mode processing are radically different, and yet there may be a common meeting ground between them in your own mind, a place where creativity gives birth to new ideas. L-mode and R-mode meet in metaphor—in the act of creating analogies.</p>

<h4 id="tip-15">Tip 15</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cultivate humor to build stronger metaphors.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Humor is neither a waste of time nor a harmless diversion; instead, it reflects an important ability necessary for thinking, learning, and creativity. It’s all about connections.</p>

<p>Humor arises from making novel connections across disparate ideas. It may be absurd, but humor is often based on identifying relationships and distorting them. For instance, “My best friend ran away with my wife. I’m sure going to miss him.” You assume the primary relationship is between the man and his wife, but instead it turns out that his relationship with his best friend is more important to him; the skewed connection makes it funny.</p>

<h4 id="tip-16">Tip 16</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Step away from the keyboard to solve hard problems.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>And then when you least expect it, you may find that the answer will emerge by itself.</p>

<h4 id="tip-17">Tip 17</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Change your viewpoint to solve the problem.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>That simple change of viewpoint, looking at the problem from the other way around,  is  by  itself  a  very  powerful  technique.  You  can  use  that  when debugging: instead of trying to prevent a difficult-to-find bug, try coming up with  three  to  four  ways  to  deliberately  cause  it.  Along  the  way,  you  might discover what’s really happening. Or perhaps try the same thing with a user interface  design:  instead  of  trying  to  come  up  with  the  perfect  layout  or workflow, make the worst layout and workflow. That might help you home in on what’s really important.</p>

<h4 id="tip-18">Tip 18</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Watch the outliers  &ldquo;rarely&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean never.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Take time to examine the “crazy” outliers or those “impossible,” astronomically unlikely events. If any of those actually did happen, what would it mean to you? What would you do differently because of it? What concerns wouldn’t matter anymore, and which would become prominent? Remember, these are still  unlikely  events,  so  don’t  start  stocking  up  on  canned  food  or  Hazmat suits just yet. But never say never.</p>

<h4 id="tip-19">Tip 19</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Be comfortable with uncertainty.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Agile software development embraces the idea of working with uncertainty.Early on, you don’t know what the project end date will really be. You’re not 100 percent certain which features will be present in the next iteration. You don’t know how many iterations there will be. And that’s perfectly OK: that’s the sort of uncertainty you want to be comfortable with. You’ll find answers as you go along, and by the end, everything will have been answered.</p>

<h4 id="tip-20">Tip 20</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Trust ink over memory; every mental read is a write</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, remember that you don’t remember very well. Memory is unreliable, and old memories will change over time, which just reassures you that your misconceptions  and  prejudices  are  valid.  Don’t  rely  exclusively  on  your memory. The Chinese proverb is correct: the palest ink is better than the best memory.</p>

<h4 id="tip-21">Tip 21</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Hedge your bets with diversity.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The best way to keep from falling victim to your generation’s particular set of biases is to embrace diversity. If you and your team all think alike, you might see your reinforced collective viewpoint as the only viable one. It’s not. Just because you treasure your approach, your individualism, or your team work doesn’t mean that younger or older folks will share that view or that it’s the right answer in this context.</p>

<h4 id="tip-22">Tip 22</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Allow for different bugs in different people.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>There are many ways to work out a solution and compromise. The only thing that is certain not to work is to try to change the other person’s temperament to match your own. That’s a recipe for disaster. A bleeding-heart F type is not going to be convinced to ignore human suffering and just follow the rules, and a rigid T type is not going to be swayed by the drama and deviate from the rules. In either case, you’re going against the grain. You might get your way depending on the situation, but the other person sure isn’t going to like it.</p>

<p>This is important background information to keep in mind when collaborating with others:</p>

<p>They may well have a different set of bugs than you do.</p>

<h4 id="tip-23">Tip 23</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Act like you&rsquo;ve envolved; breathe, don&rsquo;t hiss.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>You know what it feels like to have that rush of intense feeling come up—when the  boss  sends  you  a  snippy  email  or  that  rude  driver  cuts  you  off  to  exit without signaling.Breathe out, deeply, and get rid of the stale air. Breathe in, deeply. Count to ten. Remember that you’re the evolved one. Let the lizard reaction pass, and allow the neocortex to process the event.</p>

<h4 id="tip-24">Tip 24</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Trust intuition, but verify.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>For example, you might feel in your gut that a particular design or algorithm is the right way to go and that other suggestions aren’t as effective. Great.Now prove it.It could be your expert intuition at work, or maybe it’s just a cognitive bias or other bug. You need to get some feedback: create a prototype, run some unit tests, and chart some benchmarks. Do what you need to do to prove that your idea is a good one, because your intuition may have been wrong.</p>

<h4 id="tip-25">Tip 25</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Create SMART objectives to reach your goals.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>An objective is something you do to get you closer to that goal.
Here’s how to be SMART.</p>

<p><u>Specific:</u> Narrow that down to something concrete, such as “I want to be able to write a web server in Erlang that dynamically generates content.”</p>

<p><u>Measurable:</u> If you think you can’t measure your objective, then it’s probably not specific enough.</p>

<p><u>Achievable:</u> Make each next objective attainable from where you are now.</p>

<p><u>Relevant:</u> It needs to matter and be something that you have control over.</p>

<p><u>Time-Boxed:</u> This is perhaps the most important one. It means you need to give yourself a deadline. Without deadlines, a goal will languish and be perpetually pushed aside by the more pressing exigencies of the day. It will never happen.</p>

<h4 id="tip-26">Tip 26</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Plan your investment in learning deliberately.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>You need to make a commitment to invest a minimum amount of time on a regular basis. Create a ritual, if needed. Escape to your home office in the attic or down to the coffee shop that has free wi-fi. Not all your sessions will be equally productive, but by scheduling them regularly, you will win out in the long run. If instead you wait until you have time or wait for the muse, it will never happen.</p>

<h4 id="tip-27">Tip 27</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Discover how you learn the best.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Experiment with different learning modes. To help learn a new topic, try a couple  of  different  approaches. If you don’t usually listen to podcasts or seminars, give that a shot, in addition to your usual reading or experimenting.</p>

<h4 id="tip-28">Tip 28</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Form study groups to learn and teach.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Try to keep each group to no more than eight to ten people or so. If you have larger teams, maybe split them up into smaller groups for discussion.</p>

<p>Beside the incredible education benefits, it’s a great way to help jell a team. The team that studies together learns together, teaches each other, and learns more effectively.</p>

<h4 id="tip-29">Tip 29</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Read deliberately.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>You need more than notes; you need a mind map.</p>

<h4 id="tip-30">Tip 30</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Take notes with both R-mode and L-mode.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The most value, I find, is to take the raw notes while listening (which helps you  stay  focused  as  you  extract  salient  points  from  the  lecture)  and  then transcribe  these  raw  notes  into  “official  notes.”  Even  if  I  never  read  these notes again, the act of transcribing the raw notes is the most valuable portion of this exercise. You can do the same thing with mind maps—start with a rough messy one, and redraw it as needed. The redrawing helps form more associations in your brain.</p>

<h4 id="tip-31">Tip 31</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Write on: documenting is more important then documentation.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>You don’t have to use index cards or even real paper; the back of the napkinis just fine or maybe a large whiteboard.</p>

<p>Or perhaps you might want to take an hour to create a podcast or screencast. You may find that’s more productive for yourself and more engaging for the consumer of the information. It’s also probably cheaper than taking a week (and a committee) to produce a lengthy document.</p>

<h4 id="tip-32">Tip 32</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>See it. Do it. Teach it.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Constant retrieval is very effective for learning. Having to “go back to the well” while preparing to teach, and while having to think on  your  feet  to  respond  to  questions, all helps strengthen your neural connections.</p>

<h4 id="tip-33">Tip 33</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Play more in order to learn more.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The idea is to engage as much of your entire being in the learning process: verbal, visual, musical, numerical, gross-motor  body  movement,  fine-motor  finger  movement,  and  so  on.  All of that helps you to really play with the material and learn it more effectively.</p>

<h4 id="tip-34">Tip 34</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Learn from similarities; unlearn form differences.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>For instance, when trying to learn a functional programming language, such as Erlang or Haskell, much of what you’ve previously learned about programming languages will just get in the way. They aren’t similar to traditional procedural languages in any way that’s helpful.</p>

<h4 id="tip-35">Tip 35</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Explore, invent, and apply in your environment - safely.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Exploration is “playing” in unfamiliar territory. You need to be able to explore freely in order to learn. But that exploration has to be relatively free from risk; you don’t ever want to be held back because you’re afraid to try something. You need to be able to explore even if you’re not sure where you’re headed. Similarly, you need to be free to invent—comfortable in the knowledge that what you create might not work out. Finally, you need to be able to apply what  you’ve  learned  in  your  day-to-day  practice. An efficient, supportive learning  environment  should  allow  you  to  do  three  things,  safely: explore, invent, and apply.</p>

<h4 id="tip-36">Tip 36</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>See without judging and the act.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Don’t judge, don’t rush in with a solution, don’t criticize.You want to try to grow nonjudgmental awareness: Then act to correct it.</p>

<h4 id="tip-37">Tip 37</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Give yourself permission to fail; it&rsquo;s the path to success.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The other important lesson from the Inner Game series is the idea that permission to fail leads to success. You don’t actually need to make errors, as long as it’s OK if you did. It sounds somewhat counterintuitive, but once you play with the idea, it makes a lot of sense.</p>

<h4 id="tip-38">Tip 38</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Groove your mind for success.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Getting  used  to  what  “success”  feels  like  is  important  enough  that  it’s worthwhile to fake it first. That is, artificially create the conditions that you’d experience once you learn to perform at that level. You add whatever scaffolding is necessary to provide an approximation of the experience.</p>

<h4 id="tip-39">Tip 39</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Learn to pay attention.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>A study published in the Public Library of Science-Biology showed that training in meditation could improve a subject’s ability to pay attention throughout the day</p>

<h4 id="tip-40">Tip 40</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Make thinking time.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s return to the idea of marinating; as hard as it might be to accept, you need time to allow these multiple drafts to ferment, percolate, and develop. One line of thought will be “current” and experienced as consciousness, but that doesn’t mean that all the other drafts are discarded or irrelevant.</p>

<h4 id="tip-41">Tip 41</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Use a wiki to manage information and knowledge.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The real beauty of this approach is that once you have a place to put a specific bit of information, you’ll notice that new, relevant bits of data suddenly start to show up out of nowhere. It’s a similar phenomenon to sense tuning. For example, if I told you to start looking for the color red at a party, you’d suddenly start to see red everywhere. The same thing happens with a new model car. You’re attuned to it, so where you may not have paid attention previously, suddenly the thing you’re looking for will jump out at you.</p>

<h4 id="tip-42">Tip 42</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Establish rules of engagement to manage interruptions.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>You manage to work it out, at least you’ll have one portion of the day where you can actually be productive. I’ve heard from teams who have created email free afternoons or entire days: no email, no phone calls, no interruptions. The developers involved said these were the most productive, happiest times of the week.</p>

<p>So establish the rules of engagement (really, the rules of interruption) for your team early in the project.</p>

<h4 id="tip-43">Tip 43</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Send less email and you&rsquo;ll receive less email.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Be aware that you are setting the expectation on reply speed and email quantity</p>

<h4 id="tip-44">Tip 44</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Choose your own tempo for an email conversation.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Your email reply speed sets the tempo for the conversation. That is, the faster you reply, the faster you are expected to reply in the future. Send fewer emails, less often, and you’ll take the frantic pace down to a more reasonable level.</p>

<h4 id="tip-45">Tip 45</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Mask interrupts to maintain focus.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Don’t answer if you’re busy. Call them back when you are ready so you don’t lose all the context you’ve laboriously assembled. Put a sign on your cube during a debugging session, or close the door if you have one</p>

<h4 id="tip-46">Tip 46</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Use multiple monitors to avoid context switching.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>With all that screen real estate, it’s easy to open a bazillion applications and once again get lost in the clutter.</p>

<p>On most modern OSs, you can use a virtual desktop switcher. This allows you to have a number of different screens set up such that you can then switch between them using a special keystroke. Each screen is independent of the others and is called a workspace. The secret is in how you divvy up applications among the workspaces.</p>

<h4 id="tip-47">Tip 47</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Optimize your personal workflow to maximize context.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>If nothing else, remember to do these three things:
1. Learn to quiet your chattering L-mode.
2. Deliberately work with and add to thoughts in progress, even if they aren’t “done” yet.
3. Be aware of just how expensive context switching can be, and avoid it in all its myriad forms.</p>

<p>If you start trying to tackle at least these areas, you will be well on your way to managing your focus and taking control of your attention</p>

<h4 id="tip-48">Tip 48</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Grab the wheel. you can&rsquo;t steer on autopilot.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Go ahead and grab the wheel. You have everything you need: the same brain as Einstein, Jefferson, Poincaré, or Shakespeare. You have more facts, fictions, and viewpoints at your fingertips than at any other time in history.</p>

<p>Best of luck</p>
